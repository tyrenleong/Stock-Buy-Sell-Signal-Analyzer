# Stock Buy/Sell Signal Analyzer


## Description
This project aims to analyze stocks for buy or sell signals using the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Generally, an RSI above 70 is considered overbought and an RSI below 30 is considered oversold. This analyzer will signal BUY when RSI <= 30 and SELL when RSI >= 70.

This will be backtested on a pre-defined list of stocks.
