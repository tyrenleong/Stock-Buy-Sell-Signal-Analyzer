# Stock Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis


## Description
This project aims to optimize the weights of a portfolio given a target amount of returns. This is done through a mean-variance optimization that considers annualized returns, covariance, and standard deviation. The weighted portfolio result is then compared to an equally-weighted portfolio.
